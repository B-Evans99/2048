# 2048: a puzzle, not a game

Note: right click README.md in the file directory and Open With >> Markdown Preview for clickable links.

This Jupyter Notebook contains the raw data produced during training of the evaluations and experiments. The results of the four rounds have been graphed and smoothed to make their underlying trends visible.

All discussion and conclusion available in this notebook is also included in my submitted essay, but the markdown cells hopefully serve to clarify how and why I'm processing the data.

I recommend reading in the following order:

### Evaluations

- [Control evaluation](control%20evaluation.ipynb)
- [Variation evaluation](variation%20evaluation.ipynb)

### Experiments
- [Variation experiment](variation.ipynb)
- [Control experiment](control.ipynb)
